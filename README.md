# Environmental Sound Classification using Transformers from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of a Transformer network and a CNN-based model for classifying environmental audio recordings into 10 different classes. The models are implemented in PyTorch.

## üìå Objective

The goal of this project is to implement and compare two architectures:

1. **CNN-based Model**: A 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction followed by a fully connected classification layer.
2. **Transformer-based Model**: A CNN feature extractor followed by a Transformer encoder with a multi-head self-attention mechanism.

Both architectures are evaluated for accuracy, loss, and other key performance metrics.

## üèó Network Architectures

### üîπ **Architecture 1: CNN-based Model**
- Uses **1D-convolution** for feature extraction.
- Comprises at least **three convolutional layers**.
- A **fully connected layer** is used for classification.

### üîπ **Architecture 2: Transformer-based Model**
- Uses the same **1D-CNN** feature extractor as Architecture 1.
- A **Transformer encoder** is implemented from scratch, including:
  - Multi-head self-attention mechanism (**heads = 1, 2, 4**)
  - Addition of `<cls>` token.
- A **MLP head** is used for final classification.
